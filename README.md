# podcast_downloader
Simple Telegram bot, based on yt-dlp, and mkvmerge (MKVToolNix).\
Downloads video from all sources that yt-dlp supports, then extracts audio from them in m4a format.\
Then sends it to user in Telegram.

Python + aiogram + yt-dlp + mkvmerge

Nothing special, nothing fancy, works for me
